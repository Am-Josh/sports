## üíª install

We don't have a Python package yet. Install from source in a
[**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/roboflow/sports.git
cd examples/soccer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öΩ datasets

Original data comes from the [DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout) 
Kaggle competition. This data has been processed to create new datasets, which can be 
downloaded from the [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/).

## ü§ñ models

- [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) (Player Detection) - Detects 
players, goalkeepers, referees, and the ball in the video.
- [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) (Pitch Detection) - Identifies 
the soccer field boundaries and key points.
- [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/siglip) - Extracts 
features from image crops of players.
- [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Reduces the dimensionality of 
the extracted features for easier clustering.
- [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) - 
Clusters the reduced-dimension features to classify players into two teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è modes

- `PITCH_DETECTION` - Detects the soccer field boundaries and key points in the video. 
Useful for identifying and visualizing the layout of the soccer pitch.
- `PLAYER_DETECTION` - Detects players, goalkeepers, referees, and the ball in the 
video. Essential for identifying and tracking the presence of players and other 
entities on the field.
- `PLAYER_TRACKING` - Tracks players across video frames, maintaining consistent 
identification. Useful for following player movements and positions throughout the 
match.
- `TEAM_CLASSIFICATION` - Classifies detected players into their respective teams based 
on their visual features. Helps differentiate between players of different teams for 
analysis and visualization.
- `RADAR` - Combines pitch detection, player detection, tracking, and team 
classification to generate a radar-like visualization of player positions on the 
soccer field. Provides a comprehensive overview of player movements and team formations 
on the field.

## üó∫Ô∏è roadmap

- [ ] Add support for `BALL_DETECTION` mode to detect the soccer ball in the video.
- [ ] Add smoothing to eliminate flickering in RADAR mode.
- [ ] Add a notebook demonstrating how to save data and perform offline data analysis.
