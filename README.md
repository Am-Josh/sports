## üëã hello

In sports, every centimeter and every second matter. That's why Roboflow decided to use sports as a testing ground to push our object detection, image segmentation, keypoint detection, and foundational models to their limits. This repository contains reusable tools that can be applied in sports and beyond.

üöß **code migration in progress...**

We don't have a Python package yet. Install from source in a
